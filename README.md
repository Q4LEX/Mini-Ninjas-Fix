# Mini-Ninjas-Fix
Small executable to fix the HI-Device polling issue, making the game playable again.

## VERIFY GAME FILES
At first make sure your game files are valid. Verify their integrity using Steam. <br>
You can do that by rightclicking on Mini Ninjas in your library -> properties -> local files -> verify integrity of game files.

## HOW TO USE
<ol>
  <li>Download the binary file (on the right side, under releases) or build it yourself.</li>
  <li>Move/Copy the binary to your "Mini Ninjas" folder (the folder where ninja.exe is in).<br>You can get to that folder easily with Steam (rightclick on Mini Ninjas in your library -> properties -> Local Files -> Browse).</li>
  <li>Run the fixer binary file. You may delete it now.</li>
  <li>Enjoy.</li>
</ol>

## NOTE
I tested this fixer only on my machine and I haven't played through the whole game on my PC. There may be moments where your devices don't work (probably when you plug in a new one while the game is running). But normally it should be fine. Feel free to message me in case any errors arise.
